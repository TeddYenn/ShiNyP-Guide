Welcome!

This is a minimal example of a book based on R Markdown and **bookdown** (<https://github.com/rstudio/bookdown>).

This template provides a skeleton file structure that you can edit to create your book.

The contents inside the .Rmd files provide some pointers to help you get started, but feel free to also delete the content in each file and start fresh.
