The pipeline streamlines data input, processing, and advanced analysis to deliver publication-ready figures and reports customized to the user’s needs. *Subpage frame colors indicate available functions for customization. For example, blue frames for PCA and DAPC correspond to the Scatter Plot Plus tool for customizing scatter plots, while red and purple frames correspond to Tree Plot Plus and Manhattan Plot Plus, respectively.
