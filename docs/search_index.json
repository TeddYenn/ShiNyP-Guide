"],["sec-core-collection.html", "9 Core Collection 9.1 Core Sample Set 9.2 Core SNP Set", " 9 Core Collection ➡️ This section contains two subpages: Core Sample Set, and Core SNP Set, allowing you to capture the key samples and SNPs. 9.1 Core Sample Set Establish a core collection that represents the genetic variation of the entire population. This approach is modified function from GenoCore (Jeong et al. 2017). Required Datasets: data.frame Steps: Choose the minimum genetic coverage (%). Choose the genetic coverage differences between iterations. Click the Run Core Sample button to perform core collection. Outputs: Core Sample Coverage Data (CSV): A table listing the coverage (%) of each iteration and coverage differences between iterations. Core Sample Set (RDS): A data.frame of core samples and their genotypic information. Core Sample Info. (CSV): A table listing whether each sample is included in the core collection or not, and can be used as input data in the Population Structure/PCA subpage. Coverage Plot of Core Sample Set (PDF): Visualizes the sample coverage by each iteration. The Core Sample Set Complete! 9.2 Core SNP Set Establish a core SNP collection that represents the genetic variation observed in the full dataset. Required Datasets: data.frame Site Info. (RDS) of the current data.frame, downloadable from Data Input or Data QC pages Chromosome Info. (CSV): Reference genome information of the current study. For more details about this file, refer to Section 4.3 (SNP Density). DAPC Object (DAPC_dapc_Object.rds), downloadable from Population Structure/DAPC. Steps: Upload required datasts: Site Info. (RDS), Chromosome Info. (CSV), and DAPC Object (RDS). Choose the maximum core SNPs ratio (%). Click the Run Core SNP button to perform core collection. Outputs: Core SNP Set (RDS): A data.frame of core SNPs and their genotypic information. Core SNP Info. (RDS): A table listing whether each SNP is included in the core collection or not. Distribution of Core SNPs (PDF): An ideogram labeling the core SNPs. Site Info. of Core SNPs (RDS): Core SNPs site information file. The Core SNP Set Complete!

"],["sec-ai-report.html", "10 AI Report", " 10 AI Report ➡️ This page allows you to generate your preliminary results from prior analysis, input your OpenAI API key, select an AI model, and get an AI-driven report. Powered by the openai package https://github.com/irudnyts/openai. Step 1: Preliminary Results Enter the species name for the current study. Click the Auto-generate button to obtain Preliminary Results from the ShiNyP workflow. Note: You can download the Preliminary Results as a .txt file, edit it as needed, and upload it again for ‘AI-driven Report’ use. Step 2: AI-driven Report Select an AI model. We recommend using GPT-4o mini, which offers the most cost-efficient performance. For more information, visit: https://platform.openai.com/docs/models. Specify the task for your Preliminary Results to OpenAI. Upload the .txt file containing your OpenAI API key (e.g., “sk-……”). ▼ Example of API key file (TXT). Click the Get Report button to obtain AI-driven Report. How to get the OpenAI API key: Sign Up or Log In to the OpenAI website: https://platform.openai.com/docs/overview. Check Your Usage to track (free) credits and current consumption: https://platform.openai.com/usage. If your (free) credits are insufficient, you can manage billing and payments by visiting: https://platform.openai.com/settings/organization/billing/overview. Generate a New API Key by going to: https://platform.openai.com/api-keys. Copy and Paste the generated key into a Notepad file and save it as a .txt file for ShiNyP use. Upon signing up, OpenAI provides free credits valid for 3 months. After the free trial credits expire or are exhausted, you’ll be billed based on your usage. Costs depend on the model and the number of tokens processed.
