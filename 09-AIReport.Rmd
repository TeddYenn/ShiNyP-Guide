##### Step 1: Preliminary Results {.unnumbered}

1.  Enter the species name for the current study.

2.  Click the [**Auto-generate**]{style="color: #fff;background-color: #00a595;"} button to obtain **Preliminary Results** from the [***ShiNyP***]{style="color: #9D6853;"} workflow.

> **Note**: You can download the Preliminary Results as a `.txt` file, edit it as needed, and upload it again for 'AI-driven Report' use.

##### Step 2: AI-driven Report {.unnumbered}

1.  Select an AI model. We recommend using **GPT-4o mini**, which offers the most cost-efficient performance. For more information, visit: <a href="https://platform.openai.com/docs/models" target="_blank">https://platform.openai.com/docs/models</a>.

2.  Specify the task for your Preliminary Results to OpenAI.

3.  Upload the `.txt` file containing your OpenAI API key (e.g., "sk-......").

##### Encountered an error? Let’s fix it! {.unnumbered}

Error: HTTP 401 Unauthorized

:   This error message indicates that your authentication credentials are invalid. This could happen for several reasons, such as:

    -   You are using a revoked API key.

    -   You are using a different API key than one under the requesting organization.

    -   You are using an API key that does not have the required permissions for the endpoint you are calling.

    To resolve this error, first check that you are using the correct API key and organization ID in your request header. You can find your API key and organization ID in your account settings [here](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).

Error: Failed to Perform HTTP Request

:   This error may indicate that the request timed out, possibly due to an excessive input token count, which prevents the OpenAI model from completing the task within the allotted time.

    To resolve this issue, try selecting the 'GPT-3.5 Turbo' model to generate the report first. If successful, you can then switch to other models for subsequent tasks.
